/*Problem Statement (b):
The task is to determine if two sequences of letters, A and B, are equal when viewed as
multisets.

What is a Multiset?
A multiset is a generalization of a set that allows for multiple occurrences of the same
element. Unlike a regular set, where each element can appear only once, a multiset keeps
track of how many times each element appears.

Example:
Consider the sequences:

A = "aabbcc"
B = "baccab"
When viewed as multisets:

Multiset of A: {a: 2, b: 2, c: 2}
Multiset of B: {a: 2, b: 2, c: 2}
Here, both A and B contain the same characters with the same frequencies, so they
are equal as multisets.*/
/*Consider 2 sequences of letters (aâ€“z), A and B, stored in arrays.
 (a) Write a program to find the number of (possibly overlapping) occurrences of the
 sequence B in A. */
